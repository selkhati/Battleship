# Battleship
   Battleship is a tactical turn-by-turn guessing game where the player analyzes a 10x10 grid
   in search of enemy ships hidden beneath the surface. Player will guess where on the grid
   the enemy’s ships are located. In the hidden grid, there are (1) 1x5 ship, (1) 1x4 ship,
   (2) 3 x 1 ships, and (1) 2x1 ship. If a player/Computer guess is incorrect, the grid spot
   is marked with an “*”. If the player/Computer guesses correctly, the grid spot is marked
   with an “X.” First one to sink all the enemy ships wins.
